browned meat before onions/garlic/chilis
onion/chili circles

meat stayed together
sweeter
needs more hot / hot for normals
chili chunks need to be smaller
chili rings too big
beans are not completely done
onions are too stringy
filter out seeds

### attempt 12

* ~5 cloves garlic
* 32 oz beef broth

* 4 tbsp ground ancho
* 4 new mexico
* 2 guajillo
* 1 puya
* chili juice

good spiciness
no flavor
turkey crumbled
good after refrigeration (no salt/pepper/sugar)

doesn't work:
added brown sugar 1/2tbsp to bowl
black pepper 1tsp to bowl
salt 1/2tsp to bowl
