# Beer Battered Cheese curds

Quality: RCish

## Description

My recipe for beer battered cheese curds so far. I'm hoping to make this similar to the MN state fair curds if that's possible.

## Curd choice

This recipe seems to work best with smaller/saltier curds. My go-to curds were from Westby Creamery, which were commonly sold at Kwik Trip.
They've since switched to the larger Ellsworth curds which don't seem to work as well in this recipe.

My current attempts are to try to adapt the recipe to the larger Ellsworth curds that are available all over Minnesota.

## Current version

Recipe
* Ellsworth cheese curds
* 1 1/2 cup beer - milder ales and lagers seem to work well
* 1/2 cup flour
* 3/4 cup milk
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 egg

Directions
* Bring fryer up to 400F
* Mix ingredients together to form a batter that's slightly looser than a pancake mix (tomato bisquey?)
* Dredge cheese curds in cornstarch before placing into batter mix
* Place curds individually into the fryer to avoid clumping up
* Fry curds for 1 1/2 minutes
* Place fried curds on paper towel to dry off and be consumed
